I"Ò<p>This time Iâ€™m going to show how to model a chamfered circle. I spent a fair bit of time on this one, trying to find a simple method for modeling the shape, and I think I found the simplest one. Itâ€™s not ideal (a few ngons), but the other methods Iâ€™ve found to be overly complex with too little payoff. Let me know if you have an even better method because Iâ€™d love toÂ see it. ğŸ™‚</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong></p>

<p>Begin by creating a circle with a low edge count, in order to give aÂ chamfered look. Then add a loop between each edge for the next step.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong></p>

<p>Next, pull the middle top vertices up in order to begin creating a rounded top.</p>

<p><strong>Â 3.</strong></p>

<p>Now bevel the center loop to complete the rounded look. Feel free to use as many segments as needed. Next, add a new circle above the mesh with the same edges count as the loops of the main mesh.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong></p>

<p>The two loops can now be bridged by using the â€œbridge edge loopsâ€ tool in the edges menu (CTRL+E)</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong></p>

<p>Next, select the corners of the chamfered section and bevel them. Be sure not to bevel the top edges, so that the circular top maintains its shape.</p>

<p><strong>Â 6.</strong></p>

<p>The last step is to add holding edges to all the sharp corners and add sub-surf as desired.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it! See you in the next guide!</p>
